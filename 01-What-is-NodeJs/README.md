# What is Node.js ?

    - Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more.

    - Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.

# History

    - Node.js was initially written by Ryan Dahl in 2009,about 13 years after the introduction of the first server-side JavaScript environment, Netscape's LiveWire Pro Web.

    - The initial release supported only Linux and Mac OS X. Its development and maintenance was led by Dahl and later sponsored by Joyent.

    - Node.js combined Google's V8 JavaScript engine, an event loop, and a low-level I/O API.

# Benifits of using Node.js
